# 🔥 MARATHON MODE - COMPLETE EPIC 3 TODAY/TOMORROW

**Goal:** Finish maximum features NOW with all agents in parallel
**Timeline:** 24-48 hours (today + tonight + tomorrow morning)
**Method:** Full squad mobilization, focused execution

---

## ⚡ STRATEGY: PARALLEL EVERYTHING

Instead of sequential phases, **all agents work simultaneously** on different stories:

```
                    ORION (Master)
                          │
        ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
        │                 │                 │
    @dev (Dex)      @data (Dara)      @architect (Aria)
   Email Feature    Database         Architecture
        │                 │                 │
        └─────────────────┼─────────────────┘
                          │
        ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
        │                 │                 │
    @qa (Quinn)    @devops (Gage)      @sm (River)
   Testing        Deployment        Coordination
```

## 🎯 ROCK-SOLID REQUIREMENTS

### What MUST work:
1. **Emails must send** (critical)
   - No bounces
   - Reach inbox (not spam)
   - Content correct

2. **User management must work** (critical)
   - Can add users
   - Can assign roles
   - Can delete users
   - RLS enforced

3. **Analytics must show** (critical)
   - Numbers accurate
   - Dashboard loads fast
   - No errors

### What CAN be imperfect:
- UI doesn't need to be beautiful (functional ok)
- Features don't need all options (core only)
- Features don't need documentation (code comment ok)
- Can skip optional features

### What CANNOT fail:
- Production stability (must stay up)
- Tests (must pass 100%)
- Security (no RLS bypass)
- Data integrity (no corruption)

---

## 🚨 ESCAPE ROUTES (If Something Breaks)

### If tests fail
→ Fix immediately, don't move forward
→ Roll back commit if can't fix in 15 min
→ Ask @orion for help

### If database schema breaks
→ Rollback migration
→ Restore snapshot
→ Fix schema
→ Retest

### If production breaks
→ Immediate rollback (already have v1)
→ Fix in staging
→ Deploy again
→ Root cause analysis after

### If blocker appears
→ Alert @orion immediately
→ Suggest 2-3 solutions
→ Let @orion decide
→ Continue parallel work
