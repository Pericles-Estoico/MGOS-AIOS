## 📋 Story Overview

As an executor, I need a timer to track how long I work on each task so I can log accurate time entries and maintain visibility of time spent.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

```
AC-2.2.1: Timer component visible on task detail page
  ✓ Timer appears after task is in "in_progress" status
  ✓ Only visible to executor assigned to task
  ✓ Positioned in dedicated "Time Tracking" section
  ✓ Always accessible when task is in_progress

AC-2.2.2: Timer displays MM:SS format (00:00 to 99:59)
  ✓ Shows minutes and seconds with zero-padding
  ✓ Supports up to 99:59 (5999 seconds)
  ✓ Updates in real-time (every second)
  ✓ Uses monospace font for clarity
  ✓ Large display (readable from distance)

AC-2.2.3: Start button begins counting
  ✓ Start button visible before timer begins
  ✓ Clicking Start starts countdown from 00:00
  ✓ Button changes to Pause after start
  ✓ Timer increments every 1 second
  ✓ Accuracy within ±1 second acceptable

AC-2.2.4: Pause button pauses without reset
  ✓ Pause button visible when timer running
  ✓ Clicking Pause stops timer
  ✓ Time preserved when paused
  ✓ Button changes back to Start after pause
  ✓ Can resume from paused time

AC-2.2.5: Stop button ends session and opens time log form
  ✓ Stop button visible in Start/Pause/Stop modes
  ✓ Clicking Stop: pauses timer + opens TimeLogForm
  ✓ TimeLogForm receives duration in minutes (rounded up)
  ✓ TimeLogForm pre-populated with duration
  ✓ User can add description and date
  ✓ On form submit: time log created, timer hidden

AC-2.2.6: Reset button clears timer to 00:00
  ✓ Reset button visible when timer stopped
  ✓ Clicking Reset: timer returns to 00:00
  ✓ Resets internal state for new session
  ✓ Ready to start new count

AC-2.2.7: Time logged in minutes (rounded up)
  ✓ Convert seconds to minutes: Math.ceil(seconds / 60)
  ✓ 30 seconds = 1 minute
  ✓ 61 seconds = 2 minutes
  ✓ 0 seconds = 0 minutes (minimum)
  ✓ Validation: duration must be > 0 to submit
```

## 📝 Dev Notes

### Component Reuse
The Timer component from Story 1.4 is already implemented:
- Location: `/app/components/tasks/Timer.tsx`
- Start/Pause/Stop/Reset buttons implemented
- onStop callback returns duration in seconds
- Already integrated in task detail page

### Changes Needed
1. Ensure Timer displays minutes:seconds (MM:SS) format
2. Enhance TimeLogForm to accept pre-populated duration
3. Add duration rounding utility: Math.ceil(seconds / 60)
4. Verify API endpoint handles time log creation

### Time Rounding
```javascript
function secondsToMinutes(seconds) {
  if (seconds === 0) return 0;
  return Math.ceil(seconds / 60);
}

// Examples:
secondsToMinutes(0)   // = 0
secondsToMinutes(30)  // = 1
secondsToMinutes(60)  // = 1
secondsToMinutes(61)  // = 2
secondsToMinutes(3599) // = 60
```

### Time Log Validation
```
1 minute minimum (can't log 0 seconds)
1440 minutes maximum (24 hours)
Duration must be integer
Description optional but encouraged
Logged date defaults to today but can be overridden
```

### API Integration Pattern
From Story 1.4:
```typescript
const res = await fetch('/api/time-logs', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    task_id: taskId,
    duration_minutes: minutes,
    description: formData.get('description'),
    logged_date: formData.get('logged_date') || new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  }),
});
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- timer.test.ts
npm test -- time-log.test.ts

# Test cases:
- Timer starts, pauses, resumes, stops, resets
- Duration rounding (30s→1m, 61s→2m, etc)
- Form validation (duration 1-1440)
- API response on successful log
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm test -- timer-logging.integration.test.ts

# Test cases:
- Full timer → form → API flow
- Time log saved to database
- Audit log entry created
- RLS prevents unauthorized access
```

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Start timer and let it run 30 seconds
- [ ] Click pause and resume
- [ ] Click stop and verify form appears
- [ ] Verify duration shows rounded minutes
- [ ] Add description and submit
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Verify timer hidden after submit
- [ ] Check database for created time_log entry
