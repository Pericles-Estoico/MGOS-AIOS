## 📝 Dev Notes

### Admin Dashboard vs Executor Dashboard
```
Executor (/dashboard):
- My Tasks (assigned_to = me)
- Can start, execute, submit evidence
- Can see own time logs
- Can see own task status

Admin/Head (/team):
- All Team Tasks
- Can reassign, extend due dates
- Can see all time logs
- Can see team progress metrics
```

### Team Role Requirements
```
- admin: Full access to all team management features
- head: Can reassign, extend dates, see team analytics
- executor: Can see own tasks only
- qa: Can access /qa-reviews for review tasks
```

### Status Breakdown Query
```typescript
const { data: statusCounts } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .select('status')
  .then(({ data }) => {
    const counts = {};
    const statuses = ['pending', 'in_progress', 'submitted', 'qa_review', 'approved', 'rejected'];
    statuses.forEach(status => {
      counts[status] = data?.filter(t => t.status === status).length || 0;
    });
    return { data: counts };
  });
```

### Burndown Calculation
```typescript
// Get all approved tasks with their approval date
const { data: approvedTasks } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .select('approved_at')  // or use audit_logs table
  .eq('status', 'approved')
  .order('approved_at', { ascending: true });

// Group by date and calculate cumulative
const burndown = approvedTasks.reduce((acc, task) => {
  const date = new Date(task.approved_at).toISOString().split('T')[0];
  acc[date] = (acc[date] || 0) + 1;
}, {});
```

### RLS Consideration
- Admin sees all tasks (via RLS policy for admin role)
- Head sees team tasks they manage
- Regular executor sees only own tasks
- Ensure RLS policies properly enforce visibility

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- team-dashboard.test.ts
npm test -- status-summary.test.ts

# Test cases:
- Status counts calculated correctly
- Sorting works
- Filtering works
- Reassignment updates task
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm test -- team-management.integration.test.ts

# Test cases:
- Only admin/head can access /team
- All tasks visible (not filtered)
- Can reassign task
- Can extend due date
- Time logs aggregated correctly
- Burndown chart data correct
```

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Login as admin user
- [ ] Navigate to /team
- [ ] See all team tasks with status breakdown
- [ ] Sort by due date (nearest first)
- [ ] Filter by status (pending)
- [ ] Click task → see reassign button
- [ ] Reassign to another person
- [ ] See success message
- [ ] New assignee notified
- [ ] Extend due date
- [ ] Check time-logs dashboard
- [ ] Verify burndown chart displays

---

## 📁 File List

### New Files Created
```
✅ app/(dashboard)/team/page.tsx (NEW — status cards inline, BurndownChart, task list, pagination)
✅ app/(dashboard)/team/time-logs/page.tsx (NEW — time log report per person/task)
✅ app/components/team/QAReviewQueue.tsx (NEW — QA pending tasks widget with auto-refresh)
✅ app/api/tasks/[id]/reassign/route.ts (NEW — reassign endpoint)
```

### Note
- StatusSummary: implemented inline in team/page.tsx (cards per status with %)
- BurndownChart: reused from app/components/tasks/BurndownChart.tsx (SVG, no recharts needed)

### Files to Modify
```
app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx (add admin stats)
app/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx (add /team links)
app/(dashboard)/tasks/[id]/page.tsx (add reassign/extend)
app/api/tasks/[id]/route.ts (verify PUT support)
```

### Reuse from Story 1.4
```
Task list component patterns
API routing patterns
Authentication/authorization
```
