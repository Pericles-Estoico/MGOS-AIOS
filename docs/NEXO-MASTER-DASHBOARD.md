## 📊 Real-time Metrics Explained

### Agentes Ativos (X/6)
```
Shows: Current active agents / Total agents
Range: 0/6 → 6/6
Meaning: How many of the 6 agents are currently running
Action: If <6, check agent logs for issues
```

### Tarefas Geradas
```
Shows: Total tasks created since activation
Range: 0 → ∞ (increases continuously)
Meaning: Total output of all agents
Action: Monitor growth rate for performance assessment
```

### Taxa Sucesso
```
Shows: (Tasks Completed / Tasks Generated) × 100%
Range: 0% → 100%
Meaning: Overall success rate across all agents
Action: <70% suggests issues. Check Phase 4 for recommendations.
```

### Saúde Sistema
```
States: 🟢 EXCELLENT → 🟦 GOOD → 🟨 FAIR → 🟥 POOR

Calculation:
- EXCELLENT: approval ≥85% AND completion ≥85%
- GOOD: approval ≥70% AND completion ≥70%
